# Pybursts

## Description
This is a Python port of the [R implementation](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bursts/index.html) of Kleinberg's algorithm (described in ['Bursty and Hierarchical Structure in Streams'](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/bhs.pdf)). A bigger readme will soon follow.
